# Display a web interstitial ad

This example demonstrates how to display a web interstitial ad using the Google
Publisher Tag (GPT) library. Web interstitials are GPT-managed, full-page ads
that appear between page views. For more information about web interstitials,
see [Traffic web interstitials][admanager_hc_interstitial].

## Usage notes

* **To ensure an optimal user experience, GPT only requests web interstitial ads
  on pages that properly support the format.** Currently, web interstitials are
  only supported when GPT is running in the top window. On pages that do not
  support web interstitials, `defineOutOfPageSlot()` may return null. Be sure to
  check for this to avoid errors.
* **Only request web interstitial ads on pages or environments where you want an
  interstitial to appear.** Web interstitial ads are currently only eligible to
  serve to mobile pages, but desktop support will be added in the future.

  Note: You can use Chrome DevTools [mobile simulation][simulate_mobile] to test
  web interstitial ads on mobile from a desktop environment.
* **Web interstitial ads generate their own ad slot.** Unlike other ad types,
  you do not need to define a `<div>` for web interstitial ads. These ads
  automatically create and insert their own container into the page when an ad
  fills.
* **If using single-request architecture (SRA) on a page with multiple slots,
  donâ€™t call `display()` until static ad slots divs are created.** As explained
  in [Ad Best Practices][guide_sra], the first call to `display()` requests
  every ad slot defined prior to that point. Although web interstitial slots do
  not require a predefined `<div>`, static ad slots do. Calling `display()`
  before these elements are present on the page can result in lower quality
  signals, so we recommend delaying the initial call until after the static
  slots are defined
